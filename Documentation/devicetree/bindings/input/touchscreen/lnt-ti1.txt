* LNT Automation GmbH Touchinterface 1 (LNT-TI1)

The "Touchinterface 1" made by LNT Automation GmbH can communicate by
means of several physical transports:  I2C, SPI, UART.  In all these
versions a GPIO line signals the availability of touch data.

In addition to the standard properties for I2C slaves, SPI slaves, and
UART connected serio devices, the properties discussed below are
specific to the LNT TI1.  The GPIO specification uses the standard
binding to reference GPIO lines on a GPIO controller.  The interrupt
specification uses the standard binding to reference IRQ lines of an IRQ
controller.

See the other bindings for details on common properties:
[0]: bindings/gpio/gpio.txt
[1]: bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
[2]: bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt


Required properties:
- compatible: must contain one of "lnt,ti1-i2c", "lnt,ti1-serio", or
  "lnt,ti1-spi"
- gpios: one phandle and GPIO specifier pair, identifying the "CHG"
  (change) signal of the touch controller

Optional properties:
- interrupts: identifies an IRQ source if the GPIO controller is not
  capable of serving as an IRQ controller; if present this property
  takes precedence over the 'gpios' derived IRQ specification, in the
  absence of this property the IRQ source gets determined from the GPIO
  specification

Depending on the software implementation, alternative forms of identifying
the IRQ source might be supported.  See the 'interrupts-extended' property
in the common interrupt binding for an example.


Examples:

	touchscreen@8 {
		compatible = "lnt,ti1-i2c";
		reg = <0x08>;			/* I2C slave addr */
		gpios = <&gpio1 28 0>;		/* pen down */
	};

	touchscreen@4 {
		compatible = "lnt,ti1-spi";
		reg = <4>;			/* SPI chip select */
		spi-max-frequency = <4500000>;
		gpios = <&gpio2 24 0>;		/* pen down */
	};

	touchscreen {
		compatible = "lnt,ti1-serio";
		gpios = <&gpio1 0 0>;		/* pen down */
	};
